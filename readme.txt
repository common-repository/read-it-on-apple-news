Add "Read it on Apple News" button on single post, which linked directly to Apple News.

== Description ==

If your site is in Apple News, you need this plugin. This tiny little plugin adds an *Official* "Read it on Apple News" button under the article if that article is available in Apple News. And this button links directly to that exact article in Apple News.

If you are using [official Apple News plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/publish-to-apple-news/) to create and manage new Apple News Format, and already have contents in Apple News then this is a must have plugin for you. It will increase your Apple News content reach and user.

**Example:**
Open [this article](http://thetechjournal.com/development/apple-news-format-wordpress.xhtml), its available in Apple News, and the button will appear at the end of the content.

This initial version does not have any control panel. I basically had to create it for my publication on Apple News. If this plugin gets attention, maybe I will have more feature.
